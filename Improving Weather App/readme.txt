This project was made by Erik Dam, for Improving APS in Kolding.

The purpose of this project is to showcase some of the coding skills
and project skills, provided by Erik Dam.

In this scenario the "readme" file will include a complete "how to make this project",
with where to find all information, code, files etc., that were used in this project.

This project has the purpose of creating a weather forecast,
where it's possible to choose a location and date, and see the sunrise and sundown times.
in adittion to this, it should be possible to see a "rest of the week"-forecast from the 
chosen date.


Project code editor: Visual Studio code
Webserver stack package: Xampp
API KEY: In this project, the key is openly acessible in this code, 
I HIGLY DISCOURAGE THIS AND FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
(You should hide it through a safe key name in a different component)

Data Fetch Documentation:

extra folder:
https://openweathermap.org/widgets-constructor
Bonus material - Open weather uses widgets that contain information
I would reccomend an openweathermao.org subscription for bigger projects
as this project is solely for sunrise/sundown via API call.
